# NeoPixelSimulation
Manipulating NeoPixel strip colors in an appropriate development environment


Create a new class in the implementation package. This is where patterns and ideas will be stored. 
When the class is finished, update the Simulation.java class to run the appropriate class. The name of the new class will replace "Example", and then save and run. The code will automatically iterate. The JFrame led strip can handle vertical changes to the window, but width variations are incredibly buggy. Otherwise, the led code is perfectly functional. If the led strip is not lighting appropriately, it's because of your code.
